# Color Sort
Color sort is an interactive visualization of bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort based on a color's HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) value.
The inspiration for this project came from a combination of the "oddly satisying" and [Clement Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu).

The "oddly satisfying" trend, as described by the subreddit, is "for those little things that are inexplicably satisying".
I figured watching array of random colors sort itself into a spectrum would be a perfect little thing to bring a bit of satisfaction to those using the tool!
